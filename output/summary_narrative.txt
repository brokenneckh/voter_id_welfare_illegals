VOTER ID LAWS AND WELFARE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY NOTE
This analysis distinguishes between different immigrant populations:
- health_children: State covers illegal immigrant children
- health_adults: State covers ALL illegal immigrant adults (working age)
- health_seniors: State covers illegal immigrant seniors 65+ only
- food: State food assistance available to illegal immigrants
- eitc: State EITC available to ITIN filers

Cash assistance was REMOVED from this analysis because research shows
virtually no states provide direct cash to illegal immigrant working-age adults.
Programs like California's CAPI serve legal immigrants only.

SAMPLE SIZE
- States without effective voter ID requirement (tiers 4-5): 24
- States with voter ID requirement (tiers 1-3): 27

======================================================================
ANALYSIS 1: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ADULTS (Most Defensible)
======================================================================

Welfare score = health_adults + food + eitc (0-3 scale)

States that allow voting without ID offer an average of 0.92 welfare
benefits to illegal immigrant adults, compared to 0.00 in states requiring voter ID.
ID-required states average ZERO benefits for illegal immigrant adults.

Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.0001
Effect size (rank-biserial): -0.46

======================================================================
ANALYSIS 2: ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT (Broader)
======================================================================

Welfare score = (any health coverage) + food + eitc (0-3 scale)

States that allow voting without ID offer an average of 1.25 welfare
benefits to any illegal immigrant, compared to 0.04 in states requiring voter ID.
This represents a 33.8x difference.

Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.0000
Effect size (rank-biserial): -0.64

======================================================================
BENEFIT-BY-BENEFIT COMPARISON
======================================================================

Healthcare for illegal immigrant adults (all ages):
  No ID states: 25%  |  ID required states: 0%
  Odds ratio: 19.3x  (p = 0.0075)**

Healthcare for illegal immigrant children:
  No ID states: 54%  |  ID required states: 4%
  Odds ratio: 30.7x  (p = 0.0001)**

Healthcare for illegal immigrant seniors (65+ only):
  No ID states: 8%  |  ID required states: 0%
  Odds ratio: 6.1x  (p = 0.2165)

Food assistance for illegal immigrants:
  No ID states: 21%  |  ID required states: 0%
  Odds ratio: 15.5x  (p = 0.0181)*

State EITC for ITIN filers:
  No ID states: 46%  |  ID required states: 0%
  Odds ratio: 46.9x  (p = 0.0001)**

STATISTICAL NOTES
- * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 (Fisher's exact test)

VOTER ID STRICTNESS GRADIENT (Adults Score)
======================================================================

Tier  Category                     States Avg Score 
-------------------------------------------------------
1     Strict Photo ID              11     0.00
2     Strict Non-Photo ID          2      0.00
3     Non-Strict Photo ID          14     0.00
4     Non-Strict Non-Photo ID      9      0.56
5     No Document Required         15     1.13

Pearson correlation (strictness tier vs adults welfare score): r = 0.486
Spearman correlation: rho = 0.571 (p = 0.0000)

KEY TAKEAWAYS
======================================================================

1. The correlation between weak voter ID laws and immigrant benefits PERSISTS
   even with more rigorous methodology distinguishing populations.

2. NOT A SINGLE ID-required state offers healthcare or food assistance to
   illegal immigrant adults. The divide is stark.

3. EITC for ITIN filers shows the clearest pattern: exclusively offered by
   states without effective voter ID requirements.

4. This revised analysis addresses critiques about collapsing population
   categories and inflating cash assistance claims.
